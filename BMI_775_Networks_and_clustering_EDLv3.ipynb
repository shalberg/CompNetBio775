    "An alternative degree distribution follows the power law distribution. These networks, often called *scale-free* networks, describe many real-world networks. These graphs are characterized by hubs of of highly connected nodes, and overall short path lengths between nodes. The probability mass function is defined as \n",

    "$$ P(X = k ) \\propto k^{-\\gamma} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is a constant usually between 2 and 3. This distrubution means most nodes will only be connected by 1 edge and a few nodes will have most of the edges in the graph. We can generate approximate scale free networks using a graph generation process called the Barabosi-Albert model. The Barabasi-Arbert model is implemented with the following iGraph function: *ig.Graph.Barabasi(n, m, loops = False)* where the input parameters indicate: \n",
    "* n - the total number of vertices\n",
    "* m - the number of outgoing edges generated for each vertex, or a list containing the number of outgoing edges for each vertex. \n",

    "\n",
    "Briefly, the model is a static time-based generation model. At each time step, a new node is added. Then, from the set of existing nodes, m nodes are sampled. The probability that a node is sampled is proportional to its current degree, such that highly connected nodes are more likely to get additional edges. \n",

Higher edge betweenness is indicated by brighter (yellow) color.  At each iteration we remove the edge with the highest betweenness; in the first iteration, this is the edge between nodes 0 and 31. After 11 edges are removed, we have the first split in the dendrogram that creates two communities. This process is repeated until all edges are removed and each node is assigned to its own single-node cluster. "
